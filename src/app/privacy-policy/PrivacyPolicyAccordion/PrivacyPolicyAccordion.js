              Like most website operators, VIP NUMBER SHOP collects
              non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
              browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
              type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
              of each visitor request. VIP NUMBER SHOP's purpose in collecting
              non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
              VIP NUMBER SHOP's visitors use its website. From time to time, VIP
              NUMBER SHOP may release non-personally-identifying information in
              the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
              of its website.
            </p>
            <p>
              VIP NUMBER SHOP also collects potentially personally-identifying
              information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
              users and for users leaving comments on{" "}

                https://vipnumbershop.com
              </Link>{" "}
              blog posts. VIP NUMBER SHOP only discloses logged in user and
              commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
              and discloses personally-identifying information as described
              below.

              Certain visitors to VIP NUMBER SHOP's websites choose to interact
              with VIP NUMBER SHOP in ways that require VIP NUMBER SHOP to
              gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
              information that VIP NUMBER SHOP gathers depends on the nature of
              the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a

              If VIP NUMBER SHOP, or substantially all of its assets, were
              acquired, or in the unlikely event that VIP NUMBER SHOP goes out
              of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of
              the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
              acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer
              of VIP NUMBER SHOP may continue to use your personal information
              as set forth in this policy.
